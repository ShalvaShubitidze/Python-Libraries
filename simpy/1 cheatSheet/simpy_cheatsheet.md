# SimPy Detailed Cheatsheet

This **SimPy cheatsheet** provides an in-depth overview of the essential concepts and functions in **SimPy**, a process-based discrete-event simulation framework for Python. It covers initialization, creating processes, handling events, managing resources, time management, random variables, and more advanced features like monitoring, statistics, and custom events.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Initializing SimPy

Before using any SimPy features, you must import and initialize the library.

### Import SimPy:
- **`import simpy`**: Imports the SimPy library to your script.
    ```python
    import simpy
    ```

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Creating an Environment

In SimPy, all simulations occur within an environment. The environment controls the simulation's time and event processing.

### Functions:
- **`simpy.Environment()`**: Creates the simulation environment that manages processes and events.
    ```python
    env = simpy.Environment()
    ```

- **`env.run(until)`**: Starts the simulation and runs until the specified time or until no more events remain.
    ```python
    env.run(until=10)  # Run the simulation until time 10
    ```

- **`env.now`**: Retrieves the current simulation time.
    ```python
    print(f"Current simulation time: {env.now}")
    ```

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Creating Processes

SimPy processes are the core components of the simulation. They are Python functions that yield events during their execution.

### Functions:
- **`env.process(process_name())`**: Adds a new process to the environment.
    ```python
    def my_process(env):
        yield env.timeout(5)  # Simulates a delay of 5 units of time

    env.process(my_process(env))  # Adds the process to the environment
    ```

- **`yield env.timeout(time)`**: Creates a timeout event, causing the process to "pause" for a specified amount of time.
    ```python
    yield env.timeout(10)  # Process pauses for 10 time units
    ```

- **`yield env.event()`**: Creates a generic event, useful for synchronizing processes.
    ```python
    event = env.event()
    yield event  # Waits for the event to be triggered
    ```

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Handling Resources

Resources like machines, workers, or vehicles are shared among processes in SimPy. These resources can be controlled using SimPy's resource management system.

### Functions:
- **`simpy.Resource(env, capacity)`**: Creates a resource with a specified capacity (number of units).
    ```python
    resource = simpy.Resource(env, capacity=3)  # Resource with 3 units
    ```

- **`resource.request()`**: Requests a unit of the resource.
    ```python
    request = resource.request()  # Request a unit of the resource
    yield request  # Wait for the resource to become available
    ```

- **`resource.release(request)`**: Releases a previously acquired unit of the resource.
    ```python
    resource.release(request)  # Releases the resource
    ```

- **`resource.count`**: Returns the number of resources currently in use.
    ```python
    print(resource.count)  # Number of resources currently in use
    ```

- **`resource.release()`**: Releases a request.
    ```python
    resource.release(request)
    ```

- **`resource.capacity`**: Returns the total number of available resources.
    ```python
    print(resource.capacity)  # Total number of resources available
    ```

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Using Events and Conditions

SimPy processes interact with events to synchronize their execution. Events can be triggered when certain conditions are met.

### Functions:
- **`env.timeout(time)`**: Creates a timeout event that causes a delay for a specified amount of time.
    ```python
    yield env.timeout(10)  # Simulate a delay of 10 units
    ```

- **`env.event()`**: Creates a simple event that can be triggered manually.
    ```python
    event = env.event()
    ```

- **`event.succeed()`**: Marks the event as succeeded, allowing other processes waiting for it to proceed.
    ```python
    event.succeed()  # Trigger the event and allow waiting processes to continue
    ```

- **`event.fail()`**: Marks the event as failed, causing any waiting processes to raise an exception.
    ```python
    event.fail()  # Mark the event as failed
    ```

- **`env.exit()`**: Terminates the simulation by raising an exception.
    ```python
    env.exit('Simulation complete')  # Ends the simulation
    ```

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Time Management

SimPy uses a discrete event system to model the flow of time. You can simulate time advances and control the simulation‚Äôs progression.

### Functions:
- **`env.timeout(time)`**: Waits for the specified amount of time.
    ```python
    yield env.timeout(5)  # Waits for 5 units of time
    ```

- **`env.now`**: Retrieves the current simulation time.
    ```python
    print(f"Current simulation time: {env.now}")
    ```

- **`env.run(until)`**: Runs the simulation until the specified time.
    ```python
    env.run(until=10)  # Run the simulation for 10 units of time
    ```

- **`env.process()`**: A generator function that starts a process at the given time in the environment.
    ```python
    env.process(my_process(env))
    ```

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Monitoring Processes

SimPy includes tools for monitoring the progress of processes, events, and resources during the simulation.

### Functions:
- **`simpy.Store()`**: A queue-like container for managing items that need to be processed.
    ```python
    store = simpy.Store(env)
    store.put('item')  # Put an item into the store
    item = yield store.get()  # Get an item from the store
    ```

- **`simpy.PriorityResource()`**: A resource where requests can have priority levels.
    ```python
    pr_resource = simpy.PriorityResource(env, capacity=1)
    ```

- **`simpy.Container()`**: Allows you to model fluid or item levels that can be added or removed from a container.
    ```python
    container = simpy.Container(env, capacity=10, init=5)  # Container with initial value 5
    yield container.put(3)  # Add 3 units to the container
    yield container.get(2)  # Remove 2 units from the container
    ```

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Using Random Variables

SimPy supports random variables, which are essential for simulating real-world randomness in your processes.

### Functions:
- **`random.randint(a, b)`**: Generates a random integer between a and b.
    ```python
    import random
    random_number = random.randint(1, 10)
    ```

- **`random.uniform(a, b)`**: Generates a random floating-point number between a and b.
    ```python
    random_float = random.uniform(1.0, 5.0)
    ```

- **`random.expovariate(lambd)`**: Generates a random number based on an exponential distribution.
    ```python
    inter_arrival_time = random.expovariate(1/5)  # Average inter-arrival time of 5 units
    ```

- **`random.gauss(mu, sigma)`**: Generates a random number based on a normal distribution.
    ```python
    gaussian_value = random.gauss(0, 1)  # Random value from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1
    ```

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Example Simulation: Bank Queue

Here's a simple example of a simulation for a bank queue with customers arriving and waiting for a teller.

```python
import simpy
import random

# Bank simulation process
def customer(env, name, bank):
    print(f'{name} arrives at the bank at {env.now}')
    with bank.request() as request:
        yield request
        print(f'{name} starts being served at {env.now}')
        service_time = random.expovariate(1/3)
        yield env.timeout(service_time)
        print(f'{name} leaves the bank at {env.now}')

# Setting up the environment and resources
env = simpy.Environment()
bank = simpy.Resource(env, capacity=1)  # Only one teller available

# Creating customer processes
for i in range(5):
    env.process(customer(env, f'Customer {i+1}', bank))

# Running the simulation
env.run()
```
