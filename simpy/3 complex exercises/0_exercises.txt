1. bank loan processing
Customers apply for loans. If they have high priority, their request is processed faster. 
Otherwise, they wait. Simulate loan approvals for different customers.

ðŸ”¹ Concepts Used: PriorityResource, Timeout, Process, Queue

2. Hospital Emergency Room
A hospital emergency room has 3 doctors and 2 nurses. Patients arrive at random intervals, 
and each treatment requires both a doctor and a nurse. 
Treatment times vary depending on the severity of the condition. 
If no doctor or nurse is available, patients must wait.

ðŸ”¹ Concepts used: Multiple resources, priority queue, randomization, timeout.

3. Warehouse Logistics System
A warehouse has 2 forklifts and 4 storage zones. 
Each item must be transported from a loading dock to a designated storage zone. Some items require special handling, 
increasing transport time. Forklifts must be available to move items, and each trip takes between 3-8 minutes.

ðŸ”¹ Concepts used: Multiple resources, conditional logic, randomization, timeout.
==================================================================================



==================================================================================
4. AI Training Cluster
A company trains AI models using 5 powerful GPUs. Each job has a random processing time between 10-30 minutes. 
Some jobs require multiple GPUs to process in parallel. If no GPUs are available, jobs queue up. New jobs arrive randomly.

ðŸ”¹ Concepts used: Multi-resource allocation, parallel processing, randomization, timeout.
==================================================================================



==================================================================================
5. Space Launch Control
A space agency has a single launchpad and 3 mission control teams. 
Each rocket launch requires approval from all three teams before proceeding. 
If a team is unavailable, the launch must be delayed. Weather conditions also introduce random delays.

ðŸ”¹ Concepts used: Synchronization, multi-resource coordination, randomization, timeout.
==================================================================================



==================================================================================
6. Smart Traffic Light System
A busy intersection has traffic lights controlling four directions. 
Each light follows a predefined timing cycle, 
but real-time traffic sensors adjust durations dynamically based on congestion. 
Vehicles arrive randomly and must wait for their turn to proceed.

ðŸ”¹ Concepts used: Conditional logic, real-time updates, queue management, timeout.
==================================================================================



==================================================================================
7. Autonomous Factory Production Line
A factory produces electronic devices using a robotic assembly line. Each product 
requires multiple stages (e.g., component assembly, testing, packaging). 
Some stages take longer than others, creating bottlenecks. 
If a stage is full, production is delayed.

ðŸ”¹ Concepts used: Multi-step process, bottleneck management, resource allocation, timeout.
==================================================================================



==================================================================================
8. Stock Market Trading System
A trading platform processes buy and sell orders for stocks. 
Orders arrive randomly and are matched in a queue. Some orders have priority (large transactions), 
and market conditions affect execution times. If no matching order exists, transactions are delayed.

ðŸ”¹ Concepts used: Priority queue, randomization, conditional execution, timeout.
==================================================================================



==================================================================================
9. AI-Powered Restaurant Automation
A futuristic restaurant has robotic chefs, 
automated waiters, and a dynamic order queue. 
Some dishes take longer to prepare than others. 
If an order is complex, multiple chefs must collaborate. 
Waiters serve orders in priority order, and new customers arrive randomly.

ðŸ”¹ Concepts used: Multi-resource coordination, queue priority, randomization, timeout.
