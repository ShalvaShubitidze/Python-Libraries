2Ô∏è‚É£ Hospital Emergency Room
==================================================================================
üìå Scenario:
A hospital emergency room has 3 doctors and 2 nurses. Patients arrive at random intervals, 
and each treatment requires both a doctor and a nurse. Treatment times vary depending on the severity of the condition. 
If no doctor or nurse is available, patients must wait.

üîπ **Concepts Used:**
   - Multiple resources
   - Randomization
   - Timeout

üß† **Think About It!**
Before looking at the solution, try to answer:
1. How do you manage the availability of doctors and nurses simultaneously?
2. How do you simulate random patient arrivals and treatment times?
3. How do you ensure patients wait for both a doctor and a nurse?
