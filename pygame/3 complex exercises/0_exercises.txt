==========================================
Moving Object with Physics

Simulate a ball that bounces off the edges of the window with gravity affecting its movement. Add friction to slow it down over time.
ðŸ”¹ Concepts used: Object movement, gravity, collision detection, and physics simulation.
==========================================



==========================================
Object Collision Detection

Create two objects (e.g., circles) that move randomly. When they collide, change their color.
ðŸ”¹ Concepts used: Collision detection, object movement, and event handling.
==========================================



==========================================
Interactive Game with Multiple Objects

Create a small game where the player controls a character (e.g., a rectangle) that can move around the screen and collect items (circles). Keep track of the score.
ðŸ”¹ Concepts used: Object movement, event handling, collision detection, and score tracking.
==========================================



==========================================
Multiple Animated Objects

Create a window where multiple objects (e.g., circles or rectangles) move across the screen in different directions and bounce off edges. Implement a timer to control how fast they move.
ðŸ”¹ Concepts used: Multiple objects, animation, frame rate control, and collision detection.
==========================================



==========================================
Platformer-style Game

Create a simple platformer game with a player character that can jump and land on platforms. Make the platforms move left and right across the screen.
ðŸ”¹ Concepts used: Platformer mechanics, object collision, jumping, and movement.
