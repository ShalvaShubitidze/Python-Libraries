## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Initializing Pygame**
Before using any Pygame functions, initialize the Pygame library. Some modules need to be specifically initialized, but calling `pygame.init()` is the most common method to get everything ready.

### Functions:
- **`pygame.init()`**: Initializes all Pygame modules. This should be called at the start of your game.
    ```python
    pygame.init()
    ```
- **`pygame.mixer.init()`**: Initializes the audio system for playing sounds and music. You only need to call this if you're working with sound.
    ```python
    pygame.mixer.init()
    ```
- **`pygame.font.init()`**: Initializes the font module for rendering text.
    ```python
    pygame.font.init()
    ```
- **`pygame.display.set_mode((width, height))`**: Initializes the window with specified dimensions.
    ```python
    screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))
    ```

    ```python
    pygame.display.set_caption("My Pygame")
    ```
- **`pygame.display.get_surface()`**: Returns the surface (image) representing the window where you can draw content.
    ```python
    screen = pygame.display.get_surface()
    ```

    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False
    ```
- **`pygame.KEYDOWN`**: Event triggered when a key is pressed down.
    ```python
    if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
        if event.key == pygame.K_SPACE:

    ```
- **`pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN`**: Event triggered when a mouse button is clicked.
    ```python
    if event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:
